    <h3>What is special about my cheesecake?</h3>
    <p>My Oreo Cheesecake uses NO fussy water bath and yields smooth,
        creamy, crack-free results! It’s simple to make with an easy Oreo crust and
        topped off with chocolate ganache and homemade whipped cream. This actually isn’t a new recipe, but I am making a few slight changes to the original.<br>
        We’re using a thinner ganache layer to really let the classic cheesecake flavor shine, and we’re baking it at a lower temperature.
        I’m also using more <b>Oreos</b> in the crust to help encourage it to go even higher up the sides of the pan (this helps prevent cracks!).

                    <li><b>Cream cheese.</b> I only recommend using the brick-style, full-fat cream cheese. Tub-style cream cheese will not set up properly!</li>
                    <li><b>Sour cream.</b> Don’t skip the sour cream! I’ve mentioned this before in my no-bake cheesecake recipe — sour cream is what makes a cheesecake<br> really taste like a cheesecake. This key ingredient gives your dessert that critical depth of flavor.</li>
                    <li><b>Eggs.</b> Lightly beat your eggs before adding them to your cheesecake. Once they’re in the batter, be gentle; overbeating your cheesecake,<br> and particularly the eggs, can cause problems.</li>
                    <li><b>Oreos.</b> The star of the show! You can use regular or “double stuf” Oreos. We’ll be removing the cream centers for the crust, but you can<br> leave them in when you add the cookies to the batter. </li>
                    <li><b>Unsalted butter.</b> it's important to use unsalted butter since the cheese that we will use have enough salt in it.</li>
                    <li><b>Granulated sugar.</b> You can use brown sugar but if you choose so you might want to increase the amount a little.</li>
                    <li><b>Chocolate chips.</b> Use semisweet chocolate chips or a finely chopped semisweet baking bar</li>
                </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Discard the filling from 35 Oreos and place the cookies in the basin of a food processor.</li>
        <li>Pulse until the cookies have turned into fine crumbs, then pour into a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour melted butter over the crumbs and toss to combine.</li>
        <li>Press the crumbs into the bottom and high up the sides of a 9-inch springform pan. </li>
        <li>Cream together the cream cheese and sugar until smooth, then stir in the sour cream and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time, stirring until just combined after each addition.</li>
        <li>Fold in broken Oreo pieces.</li>
        <li>Pour your batter into your prepared pan and place on a foil lined baking sheet. Bake for 45-55 minutes,<br> then remove from the oven and use a sharp knife to gently loosen any filling that is touching the pan.</li>
        <li>Let the cheesecake cool for about an hour at room temperature, then transfer to the fridge to chill for<br> at least 6 hours, preferably overnight.</li>
        <li>Heat the cream over medium heat until simmering, then pour over your chocolate chips, cover, and<br> let sit for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk until smooth, then drizzle the ganache over the chilled cheesecake and place in the fridge<br> to chill for about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pipe whipped cream over the top, slice, and serve. </li>
    </ol>
